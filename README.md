`awake` keeps your Mac alive while coding agents are actually working. It prevents idle sleep and lid-close sleep, restores your normal power settings when work stops, and gives you a native menu bar app plus a CLI for manual control.

Unlike generic keep-awake tools, `awake` is built around long-running AI coding sessions. It can watch for Claude Code, Codex, Aider, Copilot, Amp, and similar tools, activate automatically, respect timers and manual sessions, and fail back to normal sleep cleanly.

## Highlights

- Agent-aware daemon with process and hook-based detection
- Lid-close prevention via `pmset disablesleep 1`
- Native macOS menu bar app with panel, graph, logs, and setup flow
- Multi-display blackout overlay with a global toggle hotkey
- Manual sessions, timers, and `awake run <cmd>` command-scoped protection
- Battery protection and automatic restore behavior
- Hook wiring for Claude Code and Codex
- Open source, scriptable, and local-first

## Download

If you just want the app:

- Download the latest `.app` zip from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/nickita-khylkouski/awake/releases/latest)
- Unzip `Awake-macOS.zip`
- Move `Awake.app` wherever you keep apps
- Launch it once, then follow the setup prompts

If you want the CLI + repo workflow, use the install steps below instead.

## Preview

Actual app panel:

![Awake panel screenshot](./assets/awake-panel.png)

## Quick start

```bash
npx --yes awake-agent install
```

That one command installs the CLI, builds the native menu bar app into `~/.local/bin/Awake.app`, wires supported agent integrations, and opens the app.

If you want a persistent global install instead of `npx`, use:

```bash
npm install -g awake-agent
awake install
```

If you want the repo/development workflow instead, use the install section below.

## Updating

If you installed with `npx`, update in one command:

```bash
npx --yes awake-agent@latest install
```

If you installed globally with npm:

```bash
npm install -g awake-agent@latest
awake install
```

Inside the app, Awake can also:

- check npm for a newer published version in the background
- show an `Update available` banner for self-updatable installs (`npx` and `npm -g`)
- run a one-click self-update for `npx` and `npm -g` installs

If you installed from the repo:

```bash
git pull
awake install
```

Repo installs still show version/update state in Settings, but they do not use the one-click self-update path.

For the release/update architecture decision, including why Sparkle is deferred for now, see [docs/update-architecture.md](./docs/update-architecture.md).

If `awake install` warns about `pmset`, set up passwordless sudo:

```bash
sudo bash -c 'echo "$(whoami) ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/pmset" > /etc/sudoers.d/pmset'
sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/pmset
sudo -n pmset -g
```

## Why this exists

When you run AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Aider, etc.) on a laptop, they need the machine to stay awake — sometimes for hours. Close the lid to grab coffee, and your agent dies mid-task. macOS energy settings can prevent idle sleep, but **nothing in System Settings prevents lid-close sleep**. The only way is `sudo pmset disablesleep 1`, and you need something to manage that automatically.

`awake` watches for running agents, activates lid-close prevention when they're detected, handles battery protection so your laptop doesn't die, and cleans up when agents stop.

## What you get

### CLI

- `awake start` / `awake stop` for daemon control
- `awake nosleep`, `awake yessleep`, and timed sessions like `awake for 2h`
- `awake run <cmd>` to keep the Mac awake only while one command runs
- `awake status`, `awake why`, and `awake doctor` for inspection and debugging

### Menu bar app

- Left-click toggles Awake on or off
- Right-click opens the full panel
- `Option+1` blacks out every connected display, hides the cursor, blocks local input, and turns off the MacBook keyboard backlight while the Mac keeps running
- Panel includes hero state, timers, daemon controls, logs, rules, and setup guidance
- Settings and power controls are available directly in the app

### Agent integrations

- Claude Code heartbeat hook support
- Codex notify support
- Process detection for named agent binaries
- Shared runtime state between CLI and UI

## Why it feels different

Most keep-awake apps are generic toggles. `awake` is opinionated:

- It assumes long-running agent workflows are the main job
- It treats automatic restore as part of the product, not cleanup trivia
- It gives you both a native panel and scriptable CLI control
- It keeps the product narrow instead of turning into a giant menu bar toolbox

## How it works

```

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Two layers of sleep prevention

1. **`pmset disablesleep 1`** — kernel-level flag. The *only* way to prevent sleep when the lid is closed. Requires passwordless sudo.
2. **`caffeinate -disu`** — creates IOPMAssertion to prevent idle sleep, display sleep, system sleep, and user-idle sleep. Belt and suspenders.

### Agent detection

The daemon detects agents two ways:

- **Process detection**: `pgrep -x claude`, `pgrep -x codex`, `pgrep -x aider`, etc. Works for any agent that runs as a named process.
- **Hook heartbeats**: Claude Code sessions write timestamped files to `/tmp/awake-claude-<session-id>`. The daemon checks file modification times — if a file was touched in the last 2 minutes, that session is active. More accurate than process counting since Claude Code spawns many subprocesses.

### State machine

```
             agents detected
  [normal] ──────────────────→ [nosleep-full]
     ↑                              │
     │    grace period expired      │
     │    (no agents for 5min)      │
     └──────────────────────────────┘

  At any point: battery < 5% → force sleep
```

State is stored in `/tmp/awake-state` so the menu bar app and CLI can read it without IPC.

## Prerequisites

Before installing, you need:

1. **macOS 13 (Ventura) or later** — required for the SwiftUI menu bar app (SF Symbols, modern SwiftUI APIs)
2. **Xcode Command Line Tools** — needed to compile the Swift menu bar app
   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```
3. **Passwordless sudo for pmset** — the daemon needs to run `sudo pmset` without a password prompt

## Install

All install methods end up with the same local app bundle at `~/.local/bin/Awake.app`.

### Option 1: `npx` install

Best for a fast install without keeping a global npm package around.

```bash
npx --yes awake-agent install
```

Use this again later to update:

```bash
npx --yes awake-agent@latest install
```

### Option 2: global npm install

Best if you want `awake` on your PATH as a normal command.

```bash
npm install -g awake-agent
awake install
```

Use this later to update:

```bash
npm install -g awake-agent@latest
awake install
```

### Option 3: repo/source install

Best if you want the repo locally and expect to edit the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nickita-khylkouski/awake.git
cd awake
./install.sh
```

This install path:
- Copies `awake`, `awake-build-ui`, `awake-hook`, and `awake-notify` into `~/.local/bin`
- Creates `~/.config/awake/config` with default settings
- Builds the menu bar app
- Patches Claude Code `~/.claude/settings.json` to add heartbeat hooks if Claude Code is installed
- Patches Codex `~/.codex/config.toml` notification hook if Codex is installed
- Warns if sudoers is not set up

Repo installs update with:

```bash
git pull
awake install
```

Make sure `~/.local/bin` is on your PATH. Add to your `~/.zshrc` if needed:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### Step 3: Set up passwordless sudo for pmset

This is required for lid-close prevention. If `./install.sh` warns about it, run:

```bash
sudo bash -c 'echo "$(whoami) ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/pmset" > /etc/sudoers.d/pmset'
sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/pmset
```

Verify it works:
```bash
sudo -n pmset -g    # Should print settings without asking for password
```

### Step 4: Start

```bash
awake start              # Start the daemon
open ~/.local/bin/Awake.app   # Open the menu bar app (optional)
```

No matter which install path you used, `awake install` resolves its own package or repo location, copies the helper files into `~/.local/bin`, builds the app bundle, wires supported agent integrations, and opens the app automatically after a successful install.

### Optional: Auto-start on login

Toggle in the menu bar app settings, or manually:
```bash
# The app has a "Start at login" toggle that creates a LaunchAgent.
# Or from the CLI:
cat > ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.awake.daemon.plist << 'EOF'
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.awake.daemon</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/.local/bin/awake</string>
        <string>_daemon</string>
    </array>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <dict>
        <key>SuccessfulExit</key>
        <false/>
    </dict>
    <key>ThrottleInterval</key>
    <integer>5</integer>
    <key>StandardOutPath</key>
    <string>/tmp/awake.log</string>
    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>/tmp/awake.log</string>
</dict>
</plist>
EOF
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME, then:
launchctl bootstrap "gui/$(id -u)" ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.awake.daemon.plist
```

The LaunchAgent owns the foreground daemon process. It restarts Awake after a crash or `kill -9`, but leaves it stopped after a clean `awake stop`. On every launch, Awake reconciles its durable power baseline with the real `pmset` state before resuming agent detection.

## Uninstall

```bash
awake uninstall    # Removes hooks from Claude Code/Codex, restores sleep settings
awake stop         # Stop the daemon

# Then delete files:
rm -rf ~/.local/bin/awake ~/.local/bin/awake-build-ui ~/.local/bin/AwakeApp ~/.local/bin/Awake.app
rm -rf ~/.config/awake
rm -f ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.awake.daemon.plist
rm -f /tmp/awake-*
sudo rm -f /etc/sudoers.d/pmset
```

## Usage

### CLI commands

```bash
awake start              # Start daemon (backgrounds itself, polls for agents)
awake stop               # Stop daemon, kill caffeinate, restore normal sleep
awake status             # Show current state, agents, battery, hooks

awake nosleep            # Manual nosleep (full — prevents all sleep including lid-close)
awake nosleep-display    # Nosleep but allow display to turn off (saves power)
awake yessleep           # Restore normal sleep settings manually

awake for 2h             # Nosleep for 2 hours, then restore Sleep OK
awake for 30m            # Nosleep for 30 minutes, then restore Sleep OK
awake sleep              # Stop everything and put the Mac to sleep immediately

awake run <cmd>          # Keep awake while <cmd> runs, then restore sleep
awake ui                 # Launch the menu bar app
awake install            # Set up hooks, config, build UI
awake uninstall          # Remove hooks, clean up
```

### Menu bar app

The SwiftUI menu bar app shows an icon in your menu bar:

- Green bolt icon when Awake is actively holding sleep off
- Moon icon when the Mac is in normal sleep mode

Interactions:
- Left-click toggles Awake on or off
- Right-click opens the main panel
- `Ctrl+Shift+A` opens the panel directly
- `Option+1` toggles a full-screen blackout across every connected display, hides the cursor, blocks local input, and drops the MacBook keyboard backlight to zero until you toggle it again

The panel includes:
- Hero state with the current effective wake mode
- Agent and hook monitoring
- Timers, daemon controls, sleep-now actions, and logs
- Collapsible settings and power controls
- Temperature history and diagnostics

## Configuration

Copy `config.example` to `~/.config/awake/config`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/awake
cp config.example ~/.config/awake/config
```

Edit `~/.config/awake/config`:

```bash
# Which process names to watch (space-separated)
AGENTS="claude codex aider copilot amp opencode"

# How often the daemon checks for agents (seconds)
POLL_INTERVAL=15

# After the last agent stops, keep nosleep active for this long (seconds)
# Prevents sleep during brief pauses between agent runs
GRACE_SECONDS=300

# Force sleep when battery drops below this % (even if agents are running)
BATTERY_CRITICAL=5

# Send a macOS notification when battery drops below this %
BATTERY_WARN=15
```

### Adding custom agents

To watch for additional processes (e.g., Docker, a custom script):

```bash
AGENTS="claude codex aider copilot amp opencode docker my-custom-agent"
```

The daemon runs `pgrep -x <name>` for each, so the name must match the process name exactly.

## Claude Code hook integration

For the most accurate agent detection, set up heartbeat hooks. The `awake install` command does this automatically, but here's how it works:

Claude Code supports [hooks](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) — shell commands that run on events like tool use. `awake install` configures a `PreToolUse` heartbeat automatically. The resulting hook looks like:

**In `~/.claude/settings.json`:**
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "$HOME/.local/bin/awake-hook claude",
            "timeout": 3
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This creates/updates a file per session. The daemon checks modification times — if a file was touched in the last 2 minutes, that session is considered active. Files older than 2 minutes are cleaned up automatically.

**Why hooks instead of just pgrep?** Claude Code spawns many processes (`claude`, node workers, etc.). Hook heartbeats tell you which sessions are *actually doing work* vs. idle in the background.

## File layout

```
~/.local/bin/
  awake                  # Daemon + CLI script (bash)
  awake-build-ui         # Build script for the Swift app
  awake-hook             # Claude/Codex heartbeat helper
  awake-notify           # Codex notify bridge
  AwakeApp/
    main.swift           # SwiftUI menu bar app source
  Awake.app/             # Compiled app bundle (created by awake-build-ui)
    Contents/
      MacOS/AwakeUI      # Binary
      Info.plist

~/.config/awake/
  config                 # User configuration

/tmp/
  awake-state            # Current state: "nosleep-full", "nosleep-display", or "normal"
  awake.pid              # Daemon PID
  awake-caffeinate.pid   # caffeinate process PID
  awake-for.pid          # Timer subprocess PID (when using "awake for")
  awake-for-end          # Timer end epoch (for countdown display)
  awake-last-active      # Epoch of last detected agent activity
  awake-display-sleep    # Exists if display-sleep mode is enabled
  awake-claude-*         # Heartbeat files from Claude Code hooks
  awake-codex-*          # Heartbeat files from Codex hooks

~/Library/LaunchAgents/
  com.awake.daemon.plist # Optional: auto-start on login
```

## Troubleshooting

### "sudo pmset failed" error
Passwordless sudo isn't set up. Run:
```bash
sudo bash -c 'echo "$(whoami) ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/pmset" > /etc/sudoers.d/pmset'
sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/pmset
```

### Daemon starts but Mac still sleeps on lid close
Check that `disablesleep` is set:
```bash
sudo pmset -g | grep disablesleep
# Should show: disablesleep 1
```
If it shows 0, something is resetting it. Check if another tool (Amphetamine, etc.) is conflicting.

### Menu bar icon doesn't appear
On MacBooks with a notch, the menu bar has limited space. If too many icons are present, macOS silently hides new ones. Try:
- Quit other menu bar apps to free space
- If your menu bar is crowded, use Awake's Dock icon, hotkeys, or menu bar control permissions to keep it easy to reopen
- The panel still works via `Ctrl+Shift+A` even without the icon, and `Option+1` still toggles blackout

### Orphaned caffeinate processes
If you see multiple `caffeinate` processes:
```bash
ps aux | grep caffeinate
```
Run `awake yessleep && awake nosleep` — this kills all orphaned caffeinate processes and starts a fresh one.

### Timer expired but Mac didn't sleep
The timer checks if agents are still running before force-sleeping. If agents are active when the timer expires, it stays awake and logs a message instead.

### "Action timed out (auto-reset)" in the log
The menu bar app has a safety mechanism: if an action (like toggling nosleep) takes longer than 20 seconds, it auto-resets the busy state. This prevents the UI from getting stuck with disabled buttons.

### Build fails with "no such module"
Make sure Xcode Command Line Tools are installed:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

### Desktop Mac (no battery)
Works fine — battery monitoring is skipped, the app shows "AC (desktop)" instead. All other features work normally.

## How it compares

| | awake | Amphetamine | KeepingYouAwake | Caffeine |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Agent-aware auto-activate | yes | no | no | no |
| Lid-close prevention | yes | yes | no | no |
| Hook heartbeats | yes | no | no | no |
| Grace period | yes | no | no | no |
| Battery force-sleep | yes | yes | yes | no |
| Timed sessions | yes | yes | yes | no |
| CLI control | yes | no | no | no |
| Display-only sleep mode | yes | yes | no | no |
| Open source | yes | no | yes | no |
| Menu bar app | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| Process-based triggers | yes (agents) | yes (any app) | no | no |

`awake` is not trying to be a giant utility belt. The product direction is narrower: be the best keep-awake tool for people running agentic coding workflows on a Mac.
